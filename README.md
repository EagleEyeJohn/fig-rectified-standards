# PHP Framework Interoperability Group - RECTIFIED

or "FIG-R"

The idea behind the group is to fix errors made in the actual FIG PSRs and to retify those
before it's too late.
~~If other folks want to adopt what we are doing they are welcome to do so, but that is not the aim.~~
If other folks feel forced to adopt what we're doing they are welcome to
do so, and the most certainly will :P Right?

## Why?
Because it seems to be necessary.

First of all FIG itself did make mistakes in their drafts resulting in a wrong standard now.
They knew it and always talked it down as "internal group decisions" not affecting the rest of the PHP
world. But they very well knew it would at some point, as more and more adopt to it due to a lack
of guidance making it the "de-facto standard" these days.

People are not taking a library, framework or code seriously these days, just because
it is not complying to FIG PSR(-2), but using tabs (as they always have and always should have).
This addresses this issue in the PHP community.

- [PSR-2-R](PSR-2-R-coding-style-guide.md) - "PSR-2 with tabs and consistent brace style"
- [PSR-2-R Additions](PSR-2-R-coding-style-guide-additions.md) - optional coding standard recommendations

## TODOs

- Shining `PSR-2-R` and `FIG-R` badges for the READMEs.
- PHPCS-Fixer CodeSniffer branch for this.
- Undeceive more lost souls.
- Help to make the FIG people understand what damage they caused (despite all the good things they broad, of course^^).
